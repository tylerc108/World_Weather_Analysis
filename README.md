# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of nalysis
For this analysis, we used APIs in Python to retrieve weather data for a list of cities and created a map that displayed the weather data for these cities in information bubbles. Using this data and the map we created in the first section of the analysis, we then created a vacation itinerary to use for a road trip between four cities. This itinerary included a map of driving directions from one city to the next, as well as a mapo with descriptions of weather data for each city.
